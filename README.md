# Virtual Pet Shelter Application

Welcome to Pikachu's Virtual Pet Shelter! This is a game where you will be volunteering at a
pet shelter. The user will have choices to make, such as feeding, playing with, adopting, or
admitting pets. The goal of the game is to keep all of the pets' needs as close to 0 as possible.


#### Virtual Pet Shelter Class

This class contains a collection of the pets in the shelter. This will allow you to take care of the
pets' needs. This will also allow intake or adoption. This class contains a tick method, so as time
passes, the needs of the pets will increase.


#### Virtual Pet Class

This class will retrieve the attributes of each pet, as well as accept a name and description.
